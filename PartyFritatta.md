# Party Frittata
18 eggs, served 10 people

You could really do this with any vegetables, but for the most part you'll want to pre-cook them, partly because they don't spend enough time in the oven to cook properly, partly because even things that cook quickly, like spinach, have a lot of moisture. Also you could easily add ham, sausage, bacon etc.


# Ingredients

* 4 zucchini
* 3 shallots
* 1 bunch scallions (white & light green parts)
* 1/2 bunch chives
* 1 10oz bag frozen white corn
* 1 8oz bag grated cheddar
* 1 8oz bag grated pepper jack
* 1/4 8oz bag mozzarella 
* 18 eggs
* 1/4 cup half & half
* butter, salt, pepper

# Frittata Preparation (with pre-cooked vegetables)

1. Preheat oven to 400, and preheat 10x14 roasting pan
2. Reheat any previously prepared veggies in a frying pan or microwave 
3. Mix eggs, milk/half and half, salt, pepper. Taste for salt.
4. Add 1-2 Tbsp butter to the roasting pan
5. Mix into the eggs 3/4 of the cheese, the warm(ed) vegetables, 3/4 of any fresh herbs
6. Remove pan from oven, ensure butter is coating the bottom and sides of pan (may add more) and pour in egg mixture
7. Sprinkle top with remaining cheese and fresh herbs
8. Bake for 10 minutes on a lower rack 
9. Turn heat down to 350 and move to upper rack 
10. After another 15 minutes, start checking for color/wobble. If you wiggle the pan, you want the whole thing to wobble but not seem like liquid underneath. If it's getting pretty firm, but not golden, you might turn the heat back up or turn on the broiler for a minute.
11. Ours seemed set and nicely browned about 2 inches from the edges after about 30 minutes total cooking time.

# Vegetable Prep
You can prepare any vegetables up to a few days in advance. Here's what I did this time; last night I made the zucchini and shallots but decided it wasn't enough vegetables, so grabbed corn & scallions when I was at safeway for the eggs and cheese this morning. Otherwise i would have just cooked them together with the shallots. Also I only used shallots because the onion I had turned out to have gone bad.

**Zucchini**, night before - slice, salt well, and leave in a colander for an hour. Roast at 3:50 for an hour or more. Won't be fully dry but after coming out of the oven will shrivel more. I did this cut in thick rounds, and roasted on a rack. But maybe next time cut into quarters lengthwise and then into cubes, and forget the rack. Possibly forget the pre-salting.

**Shallots**, night before - sliced thin and sauteed in butter, with a little salt at the end

**Corn & Scallions**, while cracking eggs - microwaved frozen corn to thaw, then placed in a buttery frying pan with scallions and let cook undisturbed until a little color on the bottom. Then added the zucchini and shallots (cold from fridge) to the corn to warm up together.
